Installation to disk is disabled, so the supported methods are running it as a Live USB or through a VM.
Warning: If run through a VM, there will be no persistent storage in the live session, so persistent data should be kept on the VM's virtual disk or on the host system.

Image
============
The image can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B17WBicY_pPmem1sMk94OEgzdlk

On login, it runs the script remote/setup.sh in this repository to setup firewall, etc. remotely.

For making your own image, there is also "package-changes-2016" which has the commands I used for changing the packages to a 14.04.5 base image.

Installation
============
Live USB
--------
Ubuntu System (Tested)
1) Format USB with the FAT filesystem
2) Open Startup Disk Creator
3) Select image, USB drive, and whether persistent storage will be used
4) Select "Make Startup Disk"
